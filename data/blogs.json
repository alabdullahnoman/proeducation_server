        "ans":"CORS stands for Cross-Origin Resource Sharing. It is a mechanism that allows web servers to specify which origins are allowed to access the resources on a web page.When a web page makes a request to a different domain than the one it was loaded from, the browser sends a CORS request to the server to ask for permission to access the requested resource. The server can then respond with an access control header that allows or denies the request based on the origin of the request.CORS is an important security feature of modern web browsers that helps prevent cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks and other types of web-based attacks. It is widely used in web applications that make cross-domain requests such as Single-Page Applications (SPAs) and APIs."

        "ques":"Why are you using firebase? What other options do you have to implement authentication?",
        "ans":"Firebase is a Backend-as-a-Service (BaaS) platform that provides various services for building web and mobile applications, including authentication. Firebase Authentication is a service that allows developers to add user authentication to their apps easily. It supports authentication using various providers, such as email/password, Google, Facebook, Twitter, and more. Firebase Authentication also provides several features that make it a popular choice for developers. For example, it supports secure password hashing, multi-factor authentication, and OAuth2-based authentication. It also provides client SDKs for various platforms, such as JavaScript, Android, and iOS, which makes it easy to integrate with the client-side code of an app. Besides Firebase, there are several other options for implementing authentication in web or mobile applications. For example, some developers prefer to use traditional server-side authentication techniques, such as sessions and cookies, or use third-party authentication services, such as Auth0 or Okta. The choice of authentication method depends on several factors, such as the application's requirements, the development team's skills, and the available resources."

        "ques":"How does the private route work?",
        "ans":"A private route is a route in a web application that requires authentication to access. In other words, it is a route that can only be accessed by users who have logged in to the application and have the required permissions to access the content. To implement a private route, the application checks if the user is authenticated and authorized to access the route before rendering the content. Typically, the application stores the user's authentication state in a session or a token, which is sent with each request to the server. The server then verifies the authenticity of the token and checks if the user has the necessary permissions to access the requested resource.In client-side web applications, private routes are often implemented using a client-side router, such as React Router. The router checks the user's authentication state and redirects the user to a login page if they are not authenticated. Otherwise, the router renders the requested route and its content.In server-side web applications, private routes are often implemented using middleware functions that intercept incoming requests and check the user's authentication state before allowing the request to proceed to the route handler. If the user is not authenticated, the middleware redirects the user to a login page or returns an error response.By implementing private routes, web applications can ensure that sensitive or restricted content is only accessible to authorized users, which helps improve the application's security and protect users' privacy."

        "ques":"What is Node? How does Node work?",
        "ans":"Node, or Node.js, is an open-source, cross-platform, server-side runtime environment for executing JavaScript code. It was created by Ryan Dahl in 2009 and is built on top of the V8 JavaScript engine used by the Google Chrome browser. Node allows developers to use JavaScript to build server-side applications, which was previously not possible as JavaScript was primarily used for client-side scripting in web browsers. Node provides a rich set of features and APIs for building scalable, high-performance, and event-driven applications.Node works by using an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model that allows it to handle a large number of concurrent connections without consuming excessive resources. It uses an event loop to handle I/O requests and callbacks, which allows it to operate efficiently without blocking the execution of other tasks.When a Node application receives a request, it sends the request to an event queue, which is processed by the event loop. The event loop waits for I/O operations to complete and handles them in the background, while the main thread continues to process other tasks. This allows Node to handle multiple requests simultaneously and efficiently. Node also provides a vast library of modules that can be easily installed using its built-in package manager, npm. These modules provide various functionalities, such as file system access, networking, database connectivity, and more. Overall, Node is a powerful and flexible platform for building server-side applications using JavaScript, which is one of the most popular programming languages in the world. Its event-driven, non-blocking I/O model and extensive library of modules make it a popular choice for building scalable and high-performance applications, such as web servers, APIs, and real-time applications."
